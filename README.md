# Project 4 - Conference Organization App
### Udacity - Full Stack - Project 4 - Conference Organization App

By Jerry Wardlow for the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

### About

This project is a continuation of the [Conference Central Application](https://github.com/udacity/ud858) from Udacity's Developing Scalable
Apps with Python course. Using the Google App Engine cloud hosting platform, a
highly scalable API server is implemented to handle the needs of our conference
application. This application uses Oauth2.0 to authenticate users through their
Google accounts.

### In This Repository

The core functionality of the project is contained within two files, `conference.py`
and `main.py`. These two files work together to build the App Engine project and
implement the required functionality. The class definitions for Profile, User,
Conference, and Session models and forms (among others) are defined in `models.py`.
Three YAML files are used to store configuration information. General application
configuration is contained within `app.yaml` along with route handlers and required
libraries. Indexes for datastore queries are generated and stored in `index.yaml`,
and cron configurations are placed in `cron.yaml`.
